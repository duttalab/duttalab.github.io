Our lab is engaged in conducting acoustic phonetic and speech production studies on the one hand and also large scale corpus level investigations of various speech phenomenon using automatic methods.

The general approach followed by us treats speech as a dynamic process which needs to be modeled accordingly. We study both lab-based production and also use *machine learning* to unearth patterns of acoustic variation that are caused by the overlap of articulatory gestures.

These are exciting times to be working on speech and language in general and we are happy to collaborate with researchers who share our vision. Drop [Prof. Indranil Dutta](mailto:indranildutta.lnl@jadavpuruniversity.in) a line if you are interested to work on speech dynamics.
