The speech and language processing laboratory, **SPLangLab**, at [The English and Foreign Languages University](http://efluniversity.ac.in/), Hyderabad is engaged in conducting acoustic phonetic and speech production studies on the one end and also large scale corpus level investigations of various speech phenomenon using automatic methods.

The general approach followed by us treats speech as a dynamic process which needs to be modeled accordingly. We study both lab-based production and we also use machine learning to learn about patterns of acoustic variation that are caused by the overlap of articulatory gestures.
