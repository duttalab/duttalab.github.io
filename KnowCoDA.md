# #KnowCoDA: Collaborative Discussion Agora

## What is #KnowCoDA?
**#KnowCoDA** is a community of researchers - who want to build a non-hierarchical research and collaboration framework that emphasizes the need for free flow of ideas, questions, data, methods, and science. We believe that constant and curiosity-filled engagement with science is what would free it from already existing socially constructed hierarchies. Within this broad goal, the functional practices involve constant dialog and discussion that build on already existing frameworks such as [osf.io](https://osf.io/). We are a co-op for ideas, exchanges, and co-evolution of best practices. We believe that every time we seek or offer to help, we grow.

<!--
KnowCoda sounded like a community to me (the "we" above, for ex), but this para makes it sound like a software. May want to consider adding some info on the "people" aspect: will knowcoda help academics who feel like they have no one to help? 
-->

## Who is #KnowCoDA for?
**#KnowCoDA** is a discussion and knowledge sharing platform for scientists, researchers, scholars, and individuals with an infinite appetite for collaborations and advancement of science. If you believe that science and scientific knowledge needs to be available freely and is always open for discussion then **#KnowCoDA** is for you.

<!--
is it an entirely new platform? because right now, it seems to use social media, Discord and existing platforms to help connect people. . . Below, you mention that it is a server on discord
-->

## KnowCoDA framework: What we believe?
**#KnowCoDA** is a unique non-hierarchical, collaborative discussion framework that facilitates free flow of ideas.  <!-- not needed, since the "what" has already been answered. This section can be split into 2 sections, for easier reading. -->

- We believe that scientific development hinges on collaborations and cooperative principles.
- We believe that we all benefit when our individual expertise enlightens and enlivens dialog.
- We all have insatiable curiosity and we believe that ALL our questions are equally important for the advancement of science.
- We believe that a non-hierarchical peer-learning based framework can lead to unbounded growth in our knowledge and understanding.

## KnowCoDA framework: Who we are?
**#KnowCoDA** consists of collaborators, and yes, we are all collaborators, and other role based actors and enthusiasts. It is a cooperative and learning-prioritized network of:

 - *Collaborators* - Role: Conceptual
 - *Peer mentor* - Role: Technical/Conceptual
 - *KnowCoDoer* - Role: Technical and conceptual
 - *KnowCoDataWiz* - Role: Data acquisition and use protocols
 - *KnowCoDExpert* - Role: Experiment design protocol
 <!--this is very nice! It's a bit intimidating for students, would it be possible to elaborate on things here?-->
 
## Is there a KnowCoDA use case?
 Our first use case is an open discussion forum that we will be participating in concurrent to an amazing set of talks, [IndoPhon](https://indophon.wixsite.com/india). We have mined the abstracts for these talks and have created separate channels on our server based on an [TextRank algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/textrank-for-keyword-extraction-by-python-c0bae21bcec0?gi=ed5f098baaea). We are excited that our conversations will lead to several interesting projects essential for the growth of Phonetics and Phonology research in India and beyond.

## What does KnowCoDA stand for?
**#KnowCoDA** stands for unending, unbounded, and unprecedented growth. Our fundamental belief is that we are all collaborators and our ability to cooperate and grow in this friendly, bias-free, non-hierarchical network of change agents will lead to joyous knowledge sharing and learning. Come join us and let us grow together...
