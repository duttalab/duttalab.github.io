### The Speech Dynamics Laboratory Workshop on Quantitative Methods in Linguistics (WoQuMeL)

#### What and where?
A 3-day workshop at Jadavpur University on using quantitiave methods in linguistic research and analysis
#### When?
Tentatively the last week of June or first week of July, 2024. Exact dates TBA
#### Limited participation
Due to bare minimal resources available, the workshop will be limited to 15 participants
#### Selection process
Each potential participant will write a one page (or 500 words) expression of interest (EoI) which will be evaluated and reviewed in a single-blind manner. In this EoI potential participants should state as clearly as possible, their research statement and/or questions. While no prior knowledge of quantiative analysis is expected or assumed, evaluation will depend on how sound the researhc plan is. Often times, quantiative methods are thought of as techniques that can be applied to already existing data. In this workshop we will lay emphasis on the need to design experiments with the statistical tests in mind.
#### Fees
This workshop will be free for selected participants.
